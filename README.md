<h2 id="WhatIsTether">What Is Tether For Us</h2>
<br>
Tether For Us, is a USDT exchange service based in Lebanon. The website was made for them as a way to make it easy for clients to place orders for their USDT exchange. The service is a fast and secure mean for individuals who would like to buy or sell USDT, as the service offers face-to-face transactions for added security.

<h2 id="About">About The Website</h2>
<br>

The website consists of a simple landing page for the public use, a login and an admin page for the service administrators. When loaded the user is welcomed with the hero section which consists of a title, short description, and quick access buttons. (And the navbar ofcourse). In addition, an animated rotating coin that is gold colored with a '$' symbol on one side and a green tether symbol on the other, symbolising the exchange from USD to USDT.

<br>
After the hero section we have a features section title "Why Tether For US". Meant to convince the user to use the service as it is more convenient than others.

The final section we have on the home page is the form section, where the user is to add their name, phone number, the ammount they wish to buy or sell, whether they would be buying or selling, and optionally their address. Under the form 3 icons displaying the services payment menthods are present, with each having a tooltip for the written method name.

<p align="center" style="color:gray;font-size:12px;font-weight:light;"><sub>Order Form</sub></p>
<br>
After the user has clicked the 'Confirm Order' button, a modal is displayed confirming his order details and displaying the calculated commission ammount for the amount the user has entered, in the modal an choice is given using radio buttons, where the user has to choose whether to pay the exact amount and recieve the amount - commission amount OR pay amount + commission amount and recieve the exact amount.

<br>
Finally, the admin page where admin's can change the commission rates daily. In the page 8 input field are displayed, 4 for buy rates and 4 for sell rates. The amount range is displayed as a floating label on each input field, and the old amount is in the input field. The admin can change the rates they would like and keep the ones they do not want to change. They then click on confirm and only changed rates would get updated.
